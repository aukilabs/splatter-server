# Deployment

The splatter node is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/aukilabs/splatter-server). Both deployment options are Docker-based and still run the same splatter logic under the hood.

## Initial Setup

1. First check that your NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit meet the requirements in the [Minimum Requirements](minimum-requirements.md) and update as needed:
   ```shell
   nvidia-smi
   ```
   This should output information about your GPU. If not, please double check that your installed CUDA and driver versions are correct, and restart your computer.

2. Ensure outbound HTTPS access to DDS/DMS endpoints from this host.

3. Disable power-saving settings like automatic sleep or standby mode, to keep your computer on and able to receive jobs.

## Prepare credentials + env file

Before you run the container, create a `.env` file based on the example file `server/rust/.env.example` with the required credentials:
```shell
REG_SECRET=your-registration-secret
SECP256K1_PRIVHEX=your-evm-private-key
```
Optional overrides (defaults shown):
```shell
DMS_BASE_URL=https://dms.auki.network/v1
DDS_BASE_URL=https://dds.auki.network
REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS=60
REGISTER_INTERVAL_SECS=120
REGISTER_MAX_RETRY=-1
LOG_FORMAT=text
```

Notes:
- `REG_SECRET` comes from registering a **compute node** in the Posemesh Console.
- `SECP256K1_PRIVHEX` is the hex-encoded private key of the **staked** EVM wallet for that node.

How to get the registration secret + wallet key:

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** If you run both the reconstruction and splatter nodes, you need to stake them both, on different wallets.

1. Log in to the Posemesh Console at `https://console.auki.network/`.
2. Open the **Manage Nodes** page and create a compute node (choose the appropriate operation mode).
3. Copy the registration credentials shown — you will use these as `REG_SECRET`.
4. Go to **Staking**, connect your wallet, and stake the required amount of $AUKI for that node.
5. Export the wallet private key (hex) and set it as `SECP256K1_PRIVHEX`.

## Option 1 — Use the prebuilt image (recommended)

Pull the latest stable docker image. If you are upgrading from a previous version you must **run this again** to pull the updated image.
```shell
docker pull aukilabs/splatter-server:stable
```

Start Docker using the below command, ❗**including all flags**❗
```shell
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  --env-file .env \
  --name splatter-server \
  -d \
  aukilabs/splatter-server:stable
```
You can also pin a specific release tag, for example `aukilabs/splatter-server:vX.Y.Z`.

### Verification ✅

1. After deploying, please ensure the server started correctly by running
   ```shell
   docker ps
   ```
   This should show your newly started docker container, with the STATUS showing `Up 45 seconds` or similar.
   Copy the container ID of your server, then run:
   ```shell
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```
   You should see logs indicating the node is registering with DDS and polling DMS.

2. Ensure your GPU and CUDA works correctly (using the container ID from above):
   ```shell
   docker exec <container_id> nvidia-smi
   ```
   This should show your GPU and driver information.

   Verify that torch detects your GPU:
   ```shell
   docker exec <container_id> python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CUDA not found')"
   ```
   
   If not, please double-check your setup, or see **Troubleshooting**.

## Option 2 — Build Docker image from source

### Building Docker

```bash
docker build -t splatter-server .
```

Run the image as described in Option 1, and follow the same verification steps.

## Troubleshooting ⚠️

Here are some common issues you may encounter, with suggested fixes:

### GPU not detected
- **Symptom:** Server starts but jobs fail, GPU not utilised, `CUDA not found`, or similar.
- **Fixes:**  
  - Ensure you started the Docker container with `--gpus all`.
  - Check your driver and CUDA toolkit versions against [Minimum Requirements](minimum-requirements.md).
  - Run `nvidia-smi` on host to confirm your GPU is visible.
  - Run `nvcc --version` to confirm your CUDA toolkit is installed, and with the correct version.
  - Restart your computer and try again.

### Wrong GPU used
- **Symptom:** The Docker container is using the wrong GPU, for example the integrated GPU instead of the discrete GPU.
- **Fixes:**
  - Check your system activity to see which GPU is being used.
  - Specify the correct GPU in the Docker run command using the `--gpus` flag

### Container killed or crashes under load
- **Symptom:** Server stops or computer restarts during job processing
- **Fix:**  
  - Monitor system RAM and temperatures, and check for overheating or insufficient resources.

### Docker crashes on Windows
- **Symptom:** Container stops after a few minutes on Windows.
- **Fix:**  
  - Restart Docker Desktop.
  - If the issue persists, also restart your computer.

💡 **Still stuck?**  
If your issue remains, please:  
1. Check `docker logs <container_id>` for error messages.
2. Share logs and system specs with the [Auki](https://www.auki.com) team for support.
